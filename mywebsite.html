        Let me tell you a little bit about myself.
    <br>
I'm saranya. I'm a little shy and easygoing.
I like spending time at home, just relaxing. I like watching movies, listening to music, and drawing.
I'm interested in all kinds of music.
I'm not good at sports, but I like watching cricket matches.<br>
Well, that's all.<br>
